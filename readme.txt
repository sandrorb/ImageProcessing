This is a C++ project intended to be used as a way to
learn image processing. It uses open source libraries like 
Magick++, but in the future its gonna use some DICOM library
for DICOM image manipulation.

To compile this program one must have ImageMagick (Magick++) installed.
To run it, one must have X11 installed, because of instruction "image.display()".
